<h2>WIL 🤔</h2>
<p>In doing this exercise, I was able to refresh some css concepts I learned such as flex displays. 
  It may not have been used in this exercise, but I skimmed through CSS display while planning
  how the UI would look like on different screen resolutions. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, I was also reminded of the good practices when writing HTML. 
  For example, it is always good to add the !DOCTYPE html in the first line of html files. 
  I guess this always imposed in HTML5 documents, but not the case for the previous versions, among other things.
</p>

<p>I believe that this exercise is a very good refresher for me. Thank you, Odin! 🙇‍♀️</p>
